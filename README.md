# dlpt
Damogran Labs Python Tools, a collection of modules with utility functions to ease everyday Python usage.  

## Why?
This package main purpose is to stop reinventing the wheel on top of the built-in Python functions 
in every single project. Everyday struggle with:
* how do I initialize logger and add file handler?
* how do I temporary change current working directory?
* how do I get only folders inside some location?
* how do I parse JSON file with comments?
* how do I format time to string in one line?
* how do I dynamically import some module that is not on a sys.path?
* ...

These and many more everyday Python code questions should be covered with this library. Nothing extra,
just simplified.  
Mostly built upon standard built-in code, but with a lot more straight-forward and less cluttered API.

## What?
Paths, processes, loggers, JSON handlers, pytest fixtures, time utils, watchdog, ...
